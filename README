Project name: True Solo Mutator for Killing Floor 2

Description: This mutator makes solo mode play like co-op by removing solo mode's  massive damage reductions from Zeds, forcing the syringe to heal 20 HP at base rather than 50 HP
             and gives Patty, Hans, and Matty a 30% speed boost on spawning to replicate co-op Last Man Standing boss wave scenarios.

Installation: If you wish to install this mutator, please proceed to the Killing Floor 2 workshop at https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2263399756&searchtext=
              For server install, instructions are at the bottom of the workshop page.

Usage: Start the game, open the console with the tilde key and put "open KF-Nuked?difficulty=3?gamelength=2?mutator=TrueSolo.TrueSoloMutator" without the quotation marks.
       For more advanced setups, see the bottom of the workshop page.
